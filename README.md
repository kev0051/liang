# LiDAR-Based Tree Segmentation Helper Code

The code in this repository was used to translate the millions of 3D points acquired from a LiDAR scan of Denton County into colorized voxels, which would be used to train an image detection model to segment individual trees from a depth-based heatmap.

While our team did not end up utilizing this approach in the long run, this code represents a unique potential solution to the problem that may be considered in the future.
